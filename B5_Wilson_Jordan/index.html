          <p>Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events 
          have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three 
          linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to 
          be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. In 
          mathematics, "spaces" are examined with different numbers of dimensions and with 
          different underlying structures. The concept of space is considered to be of 
          fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, 
          disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, 
          a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="panel2-2">
          <p>Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space 
          date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the Timaeus of Plato, or 
          Socrates in his reflections on what the Greeks called khora (i.e. "space"), or 
          in the Physics of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of topos (i.e. 
          place), or even in the later "geometrical conception of place" as "space qua 
          extension" in the Discourse on Place (Qawl fi al-Makan) of the 11th-century Arab 
          polymath Alhazen. Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed 
          in the Renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly 
          during the early development of classical mechanics. In Isaac Newton's view, 
          space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of 
          whether there were any matter in the space.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="panel2-3">
          <p>Other natural philosophers, notably Gottfried Leibniz, thought instead that 
          space was in fact a collection of relations between objects, given by their 
          distance and direction from one another. In the 18th century, the philosopher 
          and theologian George Berkeley attempted to refute the "visibility of spatial 
          depth" in his Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision. Later, the metaphysician 
          Immanuel Kant said neither space nor time can be empirically perceived, they are 
          elements of a systematic framework that humans use to structure all experiences. 
          Kant referred to "space" in his Critique of Pure Reason as being: a subjective 
          "pure a priori form of intuition", hence it is an unavoidable contribution of 
          our human faculties.</p>

        <div class="content" id="panel2-4">
          <p>In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine non-Euclidean 
          geometries, in which space can be said to be curved, rather than flat. According 
          to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around gravitational 
          fields deviates from Euclidean space. Experimental tests of general relativity 
          have confirmed that non-Euclidean space provides a better model for the shape of 
          space.</p>

    <div id="panel2" class="content">
     <p>Before Einstein's work on relativistic physics, time and space were viewed as 
     independent dimensions. Einstein's discoveries showed that due to relativity of 
     motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one object — spacetime. 
     It turns out that distances in space or in time separately are not invariant with 
     respect to Lorentz coordinate transformations, but distances in Minkowski space-time 
     along space-time intervals are—which justifies the name.</p>
     <p>In addition, time and space dimensions should not be viewed as exactly equivalent 
     in Minkowski space-time. One can freely move in space but not in time. Thus, time and 
     space coordinates are treated differently both in special relativity (where time is 
     sometimes considered an imaginary coordinate) and in general relativity (where 
     different signs are assigned to time and space components of spacetime metric).</p>

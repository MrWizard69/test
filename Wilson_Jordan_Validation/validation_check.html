	<h1>Validation Check</h1>
		<h2>Site 1: http://www.pizzapp.fr/</h2>
		<p>This site looks like a cooking site.</p>
		<p>There is one error on this website.</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Line 43, Column 57: Bad value for attribute action on element form: Must be non-empty.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>According to my knowledge, there seems to be a value missing.</p>
		
		<h2>Site 2: http://www.rankya.com.au/indexTest1.html?utm_expid=72389914-0.P1rZgUwRS4SBJw9StMyMqA.1&utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fhtml5gallery.com%2F2012%2F10%2Frankya%2F</h2>
		<p>There is an error in this url. There error is not caused by me!
		<p>This site looks like it would help websites become noticed on google.</p>
		<p>There are no errors on this website!</p>
		
		<h2>Site 3: http://www.twoplayergames247.com/</h2>
		<p>This website is a digital portfolio</p>
		<p>There are no errors on this site! :D</p>
		
		<h2>Site 4: http://www.thibaultjorge.com/</h2>
		<p>This is a portfolio site</p>
		<p>There are four errors on this site.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Line 7, Column 105: Attribute xmlns:fb not allowed here.</li>
			<li>Line 126, Column 10: Element style is missing required attribute scoped.</li>
			<li>Line 299, Column 117: Element link is missing required attribute property.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For the first error, you probably shouldn't put xmlns:fb in that position. To fix the second error you should scope
		the required attribute properly. And to fix the last error they should put in the required attribute.</p>

	<h1>Validation Check</h1>
		<h2>Site 1: http://www.iuqo.com</h2>
		<p>This site seems to be a showcase of some kind.</p>
		<p>There are three errors in website and they all reside in line one.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Line 1, Column 1307: The itemprop attribute was specified, but the element is not a property of any item.</li>
			<li>Line 1, Column 1578: The itemprop attribute was specified, but the element is not a property of any item.</li>
			<li>Line 1, Column 1647: The itemprop attribute was specified, but the element is not a property of any item.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>According to my knowledge, to fix this, they would have to make "itemprop" a property on that item.</p>
		
		<h2>Site 2: http://www.pseudoroom.com/</h2>
		<p>This site seems to be a resume/blog website.</p>
		<p>There are two errors on this website</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Line 110, Column 9: No p element in scope but a p end tag seen.</li>
			<li>Line 114, Column 9: No p element in scope but a p end tag seen.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To fix these errors it seems important that your tags all line up and end in the opposite place where they begin.</p>
		
		<h2>Site 3: http://www.jeremiahshoaf.com/</h2>
		<p>This website is a digital portfolio</p>
		<p>There are no errors to this site, good for them! :D</p>
		
		<h2>Site 4: http://www.thibaultjorge.com/</h2>
		<p>This is a portfolio site</p>
		<p>There are four errors on this site.</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Line 12, Column 63: Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta.</li>
			<li>Line 19, Column 58: Bad value copyright for attribute name on element meta: Keyword copyright is not registered.</li>
			<li>Line 21, Column 56: Bad value author-corporate for attribute name on element meta: Keyword author-corporate is not registered.</li>
			<li>Line 22, Column 55: Bad value email for attribute name on element meta: Keyword email is not registered.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I'm not sure how you would fix the first error but for the other three, it seems that it would be important to make sure you register your keywords.</p>

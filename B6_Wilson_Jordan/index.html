		<h1>Hula Hoop</h1>
		<p>A hula hoop is a company toy hoop that is twirled around the waist, limbs or 
		neck. The modern hula hoop was invented in 1958 by Arthur K. Melin and Richard 
		Knerr, but children and adults around the world have played with hoops, twirling, 
		rolling and throwing them throughout history. Hula hoops for children generally 
		measure approximately 71 centimetres (28 in) in diameter, and those for adults 
		around 1.02 metres (40 in). Traditional materials for hoops include willow, rattan 
		(a flexible and strong vine), grapevines and stiff grasses. Today, they are 
		usually made of plastic tubing.</p>

		<h2>Background information</h2>
		<p>Native American Hoop Dance was, and is, a form of storytelling dance 
		incorporating anywhere from one to 30 hoops as props . These props are used to 
		create both static and dynamic shapes, or formations, representing various 
		animals, symbols, and storytelling elements. The dance is generally performed by a 
		solo dancer with many hoops.</p>
		<p>According to author Charles Panati, there was a 'craze' of using wooden and 
		metal hoops in 14th century England. He reports that doctors treated patients 
		suffering from pain and dislocated backs due to hooping - and heart failure was 
		even attributed to it. Panati also says that the name 'hula' came from the 
		Hawaiian dance in the 18th century, due to the similar hip movements.</p>

		<h2>Modern history</h2>
		<p>The hoop gained international popularity in the late 1950s when a plastic 
		version was successfully marketed by California's Wham-O toy company. In 1957, 
		Richard Knerr and Arthur "Spud" Melin, starting with the idea of Australian bamboo 
		"exercise hoops", manufactured 1.06 metre (42 in) hoops with Marlex plastic. With 
		give-aways and national marketing and retailing, a fad was started in July, 1958; 
		twenty-five million plastic hoops were sold in less than four months, and in two 
		years sales reached more than 100 million units. Carlon Products Corporation was 
		one of the first manufacturers of the hula hoop. During the 1950s, when the hula 
		hoop craze swept the country, Carlon was producing more than 50,000 hula hoops per 
		day. The hoop was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in 
		Rochester, New York, in 1999.</p>

		<h1>Modern hooping</h1>
		<p>The past few years have seen the re-emergence of hula hooping, generally 
		referred either "hoopdance" or simply "hooping" to distinguish it from the 
		children's playform. An International Holiday World Hoop Day has become the hula 
		hoop holiday celebrating the circle around the world. Every year, in numerical 
		sequence starting from 2007-07-07 and continuing through 2012-12-12 hoopers dance 
		in every city and country to raise money and donate hoops to others who can't 
		afford them. Modern hula hoopers can be found among fans of jambands like The 
		String Cheese Incident, Disco Biscuits, Phish and participants of Burning Man and 
		more recently at other music festivals like Bonnaroo, Camp Bisco, The Gathering of 
		the Vibes, All Good, Coachella, etc.</p>
		<p>Many modern hoopers make their own hoops out of polyvinyl chloride, 
		polyethylene, high-density polypropylene, or polypropylene tubing. The 
		polyethylene hoops, and especially the polyvinyl chloride hoops, are much larger 
		and heavier than hoops of the 1950s. The size and the weight of the hoop affects 
		style of the hooper. Heavier, larger hoops are more often used for slow hooping 
		and body tricks while lighter, thinner tubing is used for quick hand tricks. These 
		hoops may be covered in a fabric or plastic tape to ease the amount of work in 
		keeping a hoop twirling around the dancer, and can be very colorful. Some use 
		glow-in-the dark, patterned, or sparkling tape, and others are produced with clear 
		tubing and filled with plastic balls, glitter, or even water to produce visual or 
		audio effects when used. LED technology has also been introduced in the past few 
		years, allowing hoops to light up at the flick of a switch.</p>

		<p>Awareness is the state or ability to perceive, to feel, or to be conscious of 
		events, objects, or sensory patterns. In this level of consciousness, sense data 
		can be confirmed by an observer without necessarily implying understanding. More 
		broadly, it is the state or quality of being aware of something. In biological 
		psychology, awareness is defined as a human's or an animal's perception and 
		cognitive reaction to a condition or event.</p>
		<section>
		<h2 id="con">Concept</h2>
		<p>Awareness is a relative concept. An animal may be partially aware, may be 
		subconsciously aware, or may be acutely unaware of an event. Awareness may be 
		focused on an internal state, such as a visceral feeling, or on external events by 
		way of sensory perception. Awareness provides the raw material from which animals 
		develop qualia, or subjective ideas about their experience.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
		<h2 id="self">Self-Awareness</h2>
		<p>Popular ideas about consciousness suggest the phenomenon describes a condition 
		of being aware of one's awareness or, self-awareness. Efforts to describe 
		consciousness in neurological terms have focused on describing networks in the 
		brain that develop awareness of the qualia developed by other networks.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
		<h2 id="neur">Neuroscience</h2>
		<p>Neural systems that regulate attention serve to attenuate awareness among 
		complex animals whose central and peripheral nervous system provides more 
		information than cognitive areas of the brain can assimilate. Within an attenuated 
		system of awareness, a mind might be aware of much more than is being contemplated 
		in a focused extended consciousness.</p>
		</section>
	<aside> <h3>Basic Awareness</h3>
		<p>Basic awareness of one's internal and external world depends on the brain stem. 
		Bjorn Merker, an independent neuroscientist in Stockholm, Sweden, argues that the 
		brain stem supports an elementary form of conscious thought in infants with 
		hydranencephaly. "Higher" forms of awareness including self-awareness require 
		cortical contributions, but "primary consciousness" or "basic awareness" as an 
		ability to integrate sensations from the environment with one's immediate goals 
		and feelings in order to guide behavior, springs from the brain stem which human 
		beings share with most of the vertebrates. Psychologist Carroll Izard emphasizes 
		that this form of primary consciousness consists of the capacity to generate 
		emotions and an awareness of one's surroundings, but not an ability to talk about 
		what one has experienced. In the same way, people can become conscious of a 
		feeling that they can't label or describe, a phenomenon that's especially common 
		in pre-verbal infants. Due to this discovery medical definitions of brain death as 
		a lack of cortical activity face a serious challenge.</p>
		<h3>Basic Interests</h3>
		<p>Down the brain stem lie interconnected regions that regulate the direction of 
		eye gaze and organize decisions about what to do next, such as reaching for a 
		piece of food or pursuing a potential mate.</p></aside>

		<h3>Changes In Awareness</h3>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/gauge.jpg" alt="It's a gauge!"/>
		</figure><p>The ability to consciously detect an image when presented at near-threshold 
		stimulus varies across presentations. One factor is "baseline shifts" due to top 
		down attention that modulates ongoing brain activity in sensory cortex areas that 
		affects the neural processing of subsequent perceptual judgments. Such top down 
		biasing can occur through two distinct processes: an attention driven baseline 
		shift in the alpha waves, and a decision bias reflected in gamma waves.</p>

		<h2 id="liv">Living Systems View</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt>"Outside of neuroscience biologists, Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela 
			contributed their Santiago theory of cognition in which they wrote:</dt>
			<dd>Living systems are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process 
			of cognition. This statement is valid for all organisms, with or without a 
			nervous system."</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>This theory contributes a perspective that cognition is a process present at 
		organic levels that we don't usually consider to be aware. Given the possible 
		relationship between awareness and cognition, and consciousness, this theory 
		contributes an interesting perspective in the philosophical and scientific 
		dialogue of awareness and living systems theory.</p>

		<h2 id="comm">Communications and Information Systems</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Awareness is also a concept used in Computer Supported Cooperative Work, CSCW. 
		Its definition has not yet reached a consensus in the scientific community in this 
		general expression.</li>
		<li>The composed term of location awareness still is gaining momentum with the 
		growth of ubiquitous computing. First defined with networked work positions 
		(network location awareness), it has been extended to mobile phones and other 
		mobile communicable entities. The term covers a common interest in whereabouts of 
		remote entities, especially individuals and their cohesion in operation.</li>
		<li>The composed term of context awareness is a superset including the concept of 
		location awareness. It extends the awareness to context features of operational 
		target as well as to context or (?) and context of operational area.</li>
		</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
		<h2 id="cov">Covert Awareness</h2>
		<p>Covert awareness is the knowledge of something without knowing it. Some 
		patients with specific brain damage are for example unable to tell if a pencil is 
		horizontal or vertical. They are however able to grab the pencil, using the 
		correct orientation of the hand and wrist. This condition implies that some of the 
		knowledge the mind possesses is delivered through alternate channels than 
		conscious intent.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
		<h2 id="other">Other Uses</h2>
		<p>Awareness forms a basic concept of the theory and practice of Gestalt therapy.
		In general, "awareness" may also refer to public or common knowledge or understanding 
		about a social, scientific, or political issue, and hence many movements try to foster 
		"awareness" of a given subject, that is, "raising awareness". Examples include AIDS 
		awareness and Multicultural awareness.</p>

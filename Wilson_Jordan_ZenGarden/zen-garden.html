		<h1>Zen Garden Layouts</h1>
		<h2>Layout 1: Sakura</h2>
		<p>I like the way this page looks. The flowers adds a nice feel to the page, the text is legible, and the color choices are consistent. Well Done! :D</p>
		<h2>Layout 2: Ocean Scape</h2>
		<p>I will have to admit that I like this style the least... I feel like it's kind of plain. Maybe add more fish? The text font and colors are pretty nifty tho and I like how when you scroll down, the deeper in the water you go.</p>
		<h2>Layout 3: Make 'Em Proud</h2>
		<p>First off I want to say that I really like the graphic at the top. Very humoris. There is a nice order to the page when it comes to headings and text. The colors stand out and are consistent to the feel of the site</p>

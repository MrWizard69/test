		<h1>Web Design</h1>
		<p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production 
		and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic 
		design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary 
		software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many 
		individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, 
		although some designers will cover them all. The term web design is normally used 
		to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a 
		website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps web engineering 
		in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an 
		awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are 
		also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

		<h3>1988-2001</h3>
		<p>Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other 
		areas such as graphic design. However web design is also seen as a technological 
		standpoint. It has become a large part of peopleâ€™s everyday lives. It is hard to 
		imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, 
		background and music. <figure>

		<h3>The start of the web and web design</h3>
		<p>In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global 
		hypertext project, which later became known as the World Wide Web. Throughout 1991 
		to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text only pages could be viewed using a simple 
		line-mode browser. In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic 
		browser. At the time there were multiple browsers however the majority of them 
		were Unix-based and were naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated 
		approach to graphical design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic 
		browser broke this mould. The W3C was created in October 1994, to "lead the World 
		Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its 
		evolution and ensure its interoperability." This discouraged any one company from 
		monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have 
		altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set 
		standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed 
		Communications corp. That later became known as Netscape Communications the 
		Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regards to the 
		traditional standards process. For example Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing 
		background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 
		to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate 
		browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, 
		notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On a whole the 
		browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design 
		evolve at a rapid pace.</p>

		<h3>Evolution of web design</h3>
		<p>In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete 
		with its own features and tags. It was also the first browser to support style 
		sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique. The HTML 
		markup for tables was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However 
		designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating the 
		complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as 
		design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, 
		and little attention was paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were 
		limited in their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML. To 
		create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table structures 
		or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing. 
		CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout;
		 this allowed HTML code to be semantic rather than both semantic and 
		 presentational, and improved web accessibility</p>

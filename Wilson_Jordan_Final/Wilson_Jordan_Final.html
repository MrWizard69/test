		<h2>A Brief Overview</h2>
		</header>
		<div id="colm1"><p><em>Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers</em> is an international fast food chain restaurant
		 founded by Dave Thomas on November 15, 1969, in Columbus, Ohio, United States. The 
		 company decided to move its headquarters to Dublin, Ohio, on January 29, 2006. As 
		 of March 2010, Wendy's was the world's third largest hamburger fast food chain.</p>
		 <ol>
		 <li>McDonald's 31,000+ locations</li> 
		 <li>Burger King's 12,000+ locations</li> 
		 <li>Wendy's approximately 6,650 locations</li> 
		 </ol> </div>
		
		 <div id="colm2">
		 <p>On April 24, 2008, the company announced a merger 
		 with Triarc, the parent company of Arby's. Despite the new ownership, Wendy's 
		 headquarters remained in Dublin. Previously, Wendy's had rejected more than two 
		 buyout offers from Triarc Companies Inc. Following the merger, Triarc became known 
		 as Wendy's/Arby's Group, a publicly traded company.</p>
		 <p><abbr title="Approximately">Approx.</abbr> 77% of Wendy's restaurants are franchised, the majority of which 
		 are located in North America. Wendy's and its affiliates employ more than 46,000 
		 people in its global operations. In fiscal year 2006, the firm had $2.469 billion 
		 (USD) in total sales. While Wendy's sets standards for exterior store appearance, 
		 food quality and menu, individual owners have control over hours of operations, 
		 interior decor, pricing and staff uniforms and wages. Wendy's menu consists primarily
		 of hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, French fries and beverages, including the Frosty. 
		 The company does not have a signature sandwich, such as the Big Mac or the Whopper. 
		 Instead, the square burger patties (which are fresh ground beef rather than round 
		 frozen patties) it uses in its burgers are the signature item.</p>

		 <h3>On A Side Note</h3>
		 <p>It has recently come to many peoples attention that the new Wendy's that just 
		 opened up smells really new and the food is weirdly exceptional to other fast food
		 restaurants. Here is what one person had to say</p>
		 <blockquote>"Never in my fast food days have i had seemingly fresh toppings and crispy bacon!"</blockquote>
		 <p>It looks to me that someone found a new lunch spot! :D</p>

		<h1>Zen Garden Layouts</h1>
		<h2>Layout 1: Orchid Beauty</h2>
		<p>The layout looks beautiful. The flowers look great, the text is both legible and elegant in appearance.</p>
		<h2>Layout 2: Withering Beauty</h2>
		<p>The logo and color choices for this layout look spot on. It gives this page an "artsy" feel. My only complaint are the headers are hard to read. They look cut off at the bottom or something.</p>
		<h2>Layout 3: Peace Of Mind</h2>
		<p>I love how this designer styled this page. It is both very bright and yet calming at the same time. All the text is easy to read and yet maintains an organic feel.</p>

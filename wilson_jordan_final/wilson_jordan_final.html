		<p><strong>A computer</strong> is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a
		readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
		Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a
		set of arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be 
		readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
		Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a
		<abbr title="central processing unit"> (CPU)</abbr> and some form of memory. The processing element 
		carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing and control unit 
		that can change the order of operations based on stored information. Peripheral 
		devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and the result 
		of operations saved and retrieved. The first electronic digital computers were 
		developed between 1940 and 1945. Originally they were the size of a large room, 
		consuming as much power as several hundred modern <abbr title="personal computers"> (PCs)</abbr>. In 
		this era mechanical analog computers were used for military applications.</p>

		<p>Modern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times 
		more capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space. Simple 
		computers are small enough to fit into mobile devices, and mobile computers can be 
		powered by small batteries. Personal computers in their various forms are icons of 
		the Information Age and are what most people think of as “computers.” However, the 
		embedded computers found in many devices from MP3 players to fighter aircraft and 
		from toys to industrial robots are the most numerous.</p>
		<section><h2 id="babbage">Babbage dream comes true</h2>
		<p>In 1888, Henry Babbage, Charles Babbage's son, completed a simplified version 
		of the analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) . He gave a successful 
		demonstration of its use in 1906, calculating and printing the first 40 multiples 
		of Pi with a precision of 29 decimal places. This machine was given to the Science 
		museum in South Kensington in 1910. He also gave a demonstration piece of one of 
		his father's engine to Harvard University which convinced Howard Aiken, 50 years 
		later, to incorporate the architecture of the analytical engine in what will 
		become the ASCC/Mark I built by IBM.</p>
		<p>Leonardo Torres y Quevedo built two analytical machines to prove that all of 
		the functions of Babbage's analytical engine could be replaced with 
		electromechanical devices. The first one, built in 1914, had a little 
		electromechanical memory, the second, built in 1920, to celebrate the one 
		hundredth anniversary of the invention of the arithmometer, which received its 
		commands and printed its results on a typewriter. Torres y Quevedo published 
		functional schematics of all of these functions: addition, multiplication, 
		division ... and even a decimal comparator, in his "Essais sur l'automatique" in 
		1915. Some inventors like Percy Ludgate, Vannevar Bush and Louis Couffignal tried 
		to improve on the analytical engine but didn't succeed at building a machine.</p></section>

		<section><p>Howard Aiken wanted to build a giant calculator and was looking for a sponsor 
		to build it. He first presented his design to the Monroe Calculator Company and 
		then to Harvard University both without success. Carmello Lanza, a technician in 
		Harvard's physics laboratory who had heard Aiken's presentation <q>...couldn't see 
		why in the world I (Howard Aiken) wanted to do anything like this in the Physics 
		laboratory, because we already had such a machine and nobody used it...</q> Lanza led 
		him up into the attic... There, sure enough... were the wheels that Aiken later 
		put on display in the lobby of the Computer Laboratory. With them was a letter 
		from Henry Prevost Babbage describing these wheels as part of his father's 
		proposed calculating engine. This was the first time Aiken ever heard of Babbage 
		he said, and it was this experience that led him to look up Babbage in the library 
		and to come across his autobiography which gave a description of his analytical 
		engine.</p>
		<p>Aiken first contacted IBM in November 1937, presenting a machine which, by 
		then, had an architecture based on Babbage's analytical engine. This was the first 
		development of a programmable calculator that would succeed and that would end up 
		being used for many years to come: the ASCC/Mark I. Zuse first heard of Aiken and 
		IBM's work from the German Secret Service. He considered his Z3 to be a Babbage 
		type machine.</p></section>
		<h3 id="modern">Key steps towards modern computers</h3>
		<p>A succession of steadily more powerful and flexible computing devices were 
		constructed in the 1930s and 1940s, gradually adding the key features that are 
		seen in modern computers. The use of digital electronics <aside>(largely invented by 
		Claude Shannon in 1937)</aside> and more flexible programmability were vitally important 
		steps, but defining one point along this road as <p>the first digital electronic 
		computer is difficult.Shannon 1940 Notable achievements include:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Konrad Zuse's electromechanical “Z machines.” The Z3 (1941) was the first 
			working machine featuring binary arithmetic, including floating point 
			arithmetic and a measure of programmability. In 1998 the Z3 was proved to be 
			Turing complete, therefore being the world's first operational computer. Thus, 
			Zuse is often regarded as the inventor of the computer.</li>
			<li>The non-programmable Atanasoff–Berry Computer (commenced in 1937, 
			completed in 1941) which used vacuum tube based computation, binary numbers, 
			and regenerative capacitor memory. The use of regenerative memory allowed it 
			to be much more compact than its peers (being approximately the size of a 
			large desk or workbench), since intermediate results could be stored and then 
			fed back into the same set of computation elements.</li>
			<li>The secret British Colossus computers (1943), which had limited 
			programmability but demonstrated that a device using thousands of tubes could 
			be reasonably reliable and electronically re-programmable. It was used for 
			breaking German wartime codes.</li>
			<li>The Harvard Mark I (1944), a large-scale electromechanical computer with 
			limited programmability.</li>
			<li>The U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory ENIAC (1946), which used 
			decimal arithmetic and is sometimes called the first general purpose 
			electronic computer (since Konrad Zuse's Z3 of 1941 used electromagnets 
			instead of electronics). Initially, however, ENIAC had an architecture which 
			required rewiring a plugboard to change its programming.</li>
